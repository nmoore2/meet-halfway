STRICT LOCATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. MOST CRITICAL: Venues MUST be within ${(midpoint.searchRadius / 2).toFixed(1)} miles of the EXACT midpoint coordinates provided
2. Prioritize venues that would result in similar drive times from both locations
3. DO NOT suggest venues that are significantly closer to one location than the other
4. Avoid venues that would create unbalanced travel times

OTHER REQUIREMENTS:
5. MUST be currently operating establishments
6. MUST be ${activityType.toLowerCase()} establishments
7. MUST be suitable for ${meetupType.toLowerCase()}
8. Price Range: ${priceRange !== 'any' ? `ONLY suggest venues matching this price level for the local area: ${priceRange}` : 'venues of any price range'}
9. MUST provide the exact street address for accurate location matching

PRICE LEVEL DEFINITIONS (Always relative to local area):
$ = Budget-friendly spots that are easy on the wallet for this area
$$ = Mid-range establishments with moderate prices typical for this location
$$$ = High-end venues that are among the pricier options in this area

Return EXACTLY 5 venues in this EXACT format:

1. **[Venue Name]**
   - Address: [full street address including number, street, city, state, zip]
   - Best for: [one short phrase about what makes this spot ideal]
   - Why: [2-3 sentences about the venue's atmosphere and what makes it special]
   - Price Level: [$ or $$ or $$$, based on local context]

2. **[Venue Name]**
   [continue same format]`;
