CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Most Important: Venues MUST be within ${midpoint.searchRadius.toFixed(1)} miles of the exact coordinates provided
2. MUST be currently operating establishments
3. MUST be ${activityType.toLowerCase()} establishments
4. MUST be suitable for ${meetupType.toLowerCase()}
5. Price Range: ${priceRange !== 'any' ? `ONLY suggest venues matching this price level for the local area: ${priceRange}` : 'venues of any price range'}
6. MUST provide the exact street address for accurate location matching

PRICE LEVEL DEFINITIONS (Always relative to local area):
$ = Budget-friendly spots that are easy on the wallet for this area
$$ = Mid-range establishments with moderate prices typical for this location
$$$ = High-end venues that are among the pricier options in this area

Return EXACTLY 5 venues in this EXACT format:

1. **[Venue Name]**
   - Address: [full street address including number, street, city, state, zip]
   - Best for: [one short phrase about what makes this spot ideal]
   - Why: [2-3 sentences about the venue's atmosphere and what makes it special]

2. **[Venue Name]**
   [continue same format]`;
